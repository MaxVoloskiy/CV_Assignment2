## Task 1 - Multiclass Segmentation
### Problem description
Here the problem of multi-class face segmentation is introduced. We're given a dataset with around of 1500 images of people. The main task is to write a model that can separate a person from other thing on image.

For example:

### Challenges
Our model can encounter with some difficulties, because it has to learn how to find all endges and make a right conclusion. We should do some manipulations with the image like convolution and pooling to classify pixels. And also to get back to our initial resolution we have to do some unsampling techniques like interpolation, transposed convolution etc.
